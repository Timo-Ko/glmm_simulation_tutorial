## model assumptions for simulations

# prior paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00385-9
# this investigated impact of AI vs human advice (incorrect vs correct and impact of expertise of clinician)

## advice impact

# with advice around 90% diagnostic accuracy
# do we also have to model correct/ incorrect advice? This has a huge impact!!

# no idea of impact of timing on accuracy=?!

# marginal impact of interpretability on diagnostic accuracy
